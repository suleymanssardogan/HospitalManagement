Hospital Management Systems with C#(Devexpress, Entity Framework Database First, and MSSQL)

I used this system Entity Framework Database First approach, Devexpress Design framework, Bunifu Framework, MSSQL

I developed this project to provide quick solutions to the problems encountered in hospitals and to ensure control of patients, doctors, nurses, and consultants. It involves a mailing system(photo or file), map system, openweather apı weather, and temperature forecast, and sharing location as a Google Maps link with the mailing system. Doctors can see radiology ımages of patients. Receptionists create appointments for patients. Admin can see analysis of Doctor's salary and employee numbers. Doctors can send radiology ımages that relate to the patient.
